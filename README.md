# Weather Forecast Application Development

## Project Overview

This project is a weather forecast application developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The application retrieves weather data from an API, displays it in a user-friendly interface, and provides essential features such as location-based forecasts, current weather conditions, and extended forecasts.

## Features

* Location-based forecasts: search for weather forecasts by city name or current location
* User interaction features: buttons and input fields for selecting locations and viewing different weather data
* Dropdown menu for recently searched cities
* Event listeners to handle user interactions and update the UI accordingly
* Validation of user inputs to prevent errors
* Display of location-specific weather forecasts, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions
* Extended weather forecasts for multiple days (5-day forecast)
* Error handling and validation: handle API errors gracefully and display appropriate error messages to users

## Technical Requirements

* HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
* Tailwind CSS for styling
* Version control system (Git) for tracking changes throughout development
* Weather API provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI)



## Usage

1. Open the application in a web browser
2. Search for a city or select your current location to view the weather forecast
3. Use the dropdown menu to view recently searched cities
4. Click on a city in the dropdown menu to update the weather data
5. View extended weather forecasts for multiple days

## Code Structure

* `index.html`: main HTML file for the application
* `styles.css`: CSS file for styling using Tailwind CSS
* `script.js`: JavaScript file for application logic
